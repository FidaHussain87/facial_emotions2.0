# tensorflow TODO: it can be uncommented if you want to use tensorflow for training the model within model_train.py
# For M-series Macs, list tensorflow-macos and tensorflow-metal before deepface
# to help pip establish the correct TensorFlow version for Apple Silicon first.
# tensorflow-macos  # For M-series Macs
#tensorflow-metal  # For M-series Macs GPU acceleration
# deepface          # deepface should then use the TensorFlow version installed by tensorflow-macos only for /server/main.py not in this custom trained model
# python-multipart use this only when you want to upload files through the web interface
numpy


# If not on M-series Mac, replace tensorflow-macos and tensorflow-metal with:
# tensorflow  # or tensorflow-cpu if you don't have a compatible GPU

# Note on versions: If dependency conflicts like the one you experienced persist,
# try pinning versions. For example, based on your error:
# tensorflow-macos==2.16.2
# tensorflow-metal  # (usually version-tied, no explicit pinning needed if TF-macos is pinned)
# deepface==0.0.92  # (or the latest version of deepface; check its TF compatibility)
# You can find the latest deepface version on PyPI.
# Always ensure your virtual environment is clean before reinstalling with pinned versions.
